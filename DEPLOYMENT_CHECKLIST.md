# ðŸš€ FloNeo Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Tasks

### 1. Code Review & Cleanup
- [ ] Remove console.log statements from production code
- [ ] Update hardcoded URLs to use environment variables
- [ ] Ensure all sensitive data uses environment variables
- [ ] Remove unused dependencies from package.json
- [ ] Update package versions to latest stable

### 2. Environment Configuration
- [ ] Create .env.example files for both client and server
- [ ] Verify all required environment variables are documented
- [ ] Test with production-like environment variables
- [ ] Ensure JWT secrets are strong and unique

### 3. Database Preparation
- [ ] Run database migrations
- [ ] Verify Prisma schema is production-ready
- [ ] Test database connection with production credentials
- [ ] Create database backups if migrating existing data

### 4. Security Checklist
- [ ] Enable CORS with specific origins (not *)
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
- [ ] Ensure HTTPS is enforced in production
- [ ] Validate all user inputs
- [ ] Implement proper error handling (no sensitive data in errors)

### 5. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Enable Next.js production optimizations
- [ ] Implement image optimization
- [ ] Add caching headers for static assets
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Enable gzip compression

### 6. Testing
- [ ] Run all backend tests
- [ ] Test frontend build process
- [ ] Verify API endpoints work correctly
- [ ] Test authentication flow
- [ ] Test file upload functionality
- [ ] Verify real-time features (Socket.io)
